    <h1>A Letter To My Darling</h1>
    <!-- apology letter added as a paragraph-->
        <p>
            To my Loverly darling,

            I am very sorry for my behavior yesterday. I was confused and angry at that time to realize my mistake. I can understand your feelings and sadness that you are going through because of me. My intentions were not to hurt you but the situation was not good and I lost control over me and my emotions.
            <br><br>
            I know that I have committed such mistakes in the future too but I regret all those mistakes. I make all those silly mistakes but more than that I love you and care for you. I Love you more than anything in this world. Also, I am ready to face all your wraths as well as I deserve all this because I have hurt you so badly and any idiot will only do so.
            <br><br>
            But believe me, I love you very much and you are my life and I regret whatever I have done to you until the time. Please give me one more chance to prove my love to you.
            <br><br>
            Your idiot yet very sweet Lover ðŸ˜‰
            <br><br>

    <h2>A Special Dinner Butter Chicken & Garlic Naan</h2>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>125ml plain yoghurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 and a 1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken breasts into cubes and mix the marinade ingredients with the chicken, making sure the chicken is well coated. Cover the bowl and place in the fridge overnight, ideally for for 24 hours, however 12 hours is fine too.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized pan, heat the oil and take the chicken out of the marinade and place in the pan â€“ donâ€™t scrape all the marinade out of the bowl and into the pan, we just want the chicken!</li>
            <li>Fry for 3-4 minutes on high heat to seal the chicken and develop the flavours.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down to low and add the tomato puree, sugar and salt and simmer for 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the cream and taste whether or not you would like to add more.</li>
            <li>Serve with basmati rice, sambals and coriander. (a few naan breads would be great too!!</li>
        </ol>
