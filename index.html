        <p>
            To my Lovely Wife,

            I am very sorry for my behavior yesterday (mention day). I was confused and angry at that time to realize my mistake. I can understand your feelings and sadness that you are going through because of me. My intentions were not to hurt you but the situation was not good and I lost control over me and my emotions.
            <br><br>
            I know that I have committed such mistakes in the future too but I regret all those mistakes. I make all those silly mistakes but more than that I love you and care for you. I Love you more than anything in this world. Also, I am ready to face all your wraths as well as I deserve all this because I have hurt you so badly and any idiot will only do so.
            <br><br>
            But believe me, I love you very much and you are my life and I regret whatever I have done to you until the time. Please give me one more chance to prove my love to you.
            <br><br>
            Your idiot yet very sweet husband ðŸ˜‰
            <br><br>
            Ismet Samsodien
